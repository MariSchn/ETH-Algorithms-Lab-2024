## üìù Problem Description

Given $n$ students, each being defined through $c$ characteristics, the task is to pair the students, such that the minimum amount of shared characteristics between two paired up students is maximized.

Additionally a value $f$ is given, that represents a threshold for the number of shared characteristics in any pair. Based on this value $f$ the output should be `optimal` if the maximum shared characteristics in any pair is less than or equal to $f$, and `not optimal` otherwise.

<summary>Hint #2</summary>

We can model this problem as a graph, where each student represents a node. In this graph we can then define the edges such that we only need to find the maximum matching in this graph to solve the problem.

<summary>Hint #3</summary>

Note that to give the final output, we do not need to find the actual maximum matching. We only need to determine, whether a matching exists that covers all students and is greater than $f$ in terms of the number of shared characteristics in any pair.

<summary>Final Solution</summary>

This problem can be solved by modeling it as a graph problem, specifically by searching for a matching. 

The core idea is to translate the student pairing problem into a graph as the problem in this case becomes a matching problem.
*  **Vertices**: Each of the $N$ students is represented as a vertex in an undirected graph.
*  **Edges**: Edges are added between students based on their number of shared characteristics. Since the problem only requires us to determine whether a matching exists that covers all students and is greater than $f$ in terms of the number of shared characteristics in any pair, we only need to add edges between students who share more than $f$ characteristics.

If there exists a perfect matching (matching that contains all nodes) in this graph, we know that the previous assignment, defined by $f$ is `not optimal` as there exists a matching such that all students share $> f$ characteristics. If there does not exist a matching, the previous assignment was `optimal`. 
To determine whether the matching is perfect or not, we can simply look at the amount number of edges in the matching. The matching is perfect if it contains exactly $n/2$ edges, as each edge connects $2$ students.

**Note**: To efficiently count common characteristics between any two students, we can store each student's characteristics in a set (like `std::unordered_set`). This allows for very fast lookups.

    std::vector<std::unordered_set<std::string>> students(n, std::unordered_set<std::string>{});
