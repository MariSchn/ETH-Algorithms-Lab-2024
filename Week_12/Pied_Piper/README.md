# The Pied Piper of Hamelin

## üìù Problem Description

You are tasked with finding an optimal route for the Pied Piper through the city of Hamelin to maximize the number of rats he collects. The city has $N$ public squares, numbered $0$ to $N-1$, and $M$ one-way streets. Each street connects two squares and has a specific number of rats on it.

An "acceptable plan" for the Piper's route must satisfy several conditions:
1.  The route must start and end at square $0$.
2.  It must pass through the main public square, $N-1$.
3.  No square may be visited more than once, with the exception of square $0$, which is both the start and end point.
4.  The route must be a concatenation of two specific types of paths:
    *   A **monotonically increasing path** from square $0$ to square $N-1$. This means for any street on this path segment from square $s_i$ to $s_{i+1}$, it must hold that $s_i < s_{i+1}$.
    *   A **monotonically decreasing path** from square $N-1$ back to square $0$. This means for any street on this path segment from square $s_j$ to $s_{j+1}$, it must hold that $s_j > s_{j+1}$.

Given the layout of the squares and streets, your goal is to determine the maximum total number of rats the Piper can collect on any single acceptable plan.

## üí° Hints

<summary>Hint #1</summary>
The problem asks for a single tour that starts at 0, goes to $N-1$, and returns to 0. Try to visualize this tour. It can be deconstructed into two distinct paths: one from square $0$ to $N-1$ and another from square $N-1$ to $0$. The key constraint is that these two paths must not share any intermediate squares.

<summary>Hint #2</summary>
This problem structure, involving finding optimal paths with specific constraints, is a strong indicator for dynamic programming. Consider building the two required paths simultaneously. What information would you need to keep track of in your DP state? To extend the paths, you certainly need to know their current endpoints.

<details>
<summary>Hint #3</summary>
A common pitfall is to calculate the best increasing path from $0$ to $N-1$ and the best decreasing path from $N-1$ to $0$ independently and then add their scores. This approach fails because the two paths might share intermediate squares, which is forbidden. Your DP state must enforce the disjointness constraint.

<details>
<summary>Hint #4</summary>
Let's define a DP state `dp[i][j]` representing the maximum score for two disjoint, monotonically increasing paths starting from square $0$ and ending at squares `i` and `j`. Why two *increasing* paths? A decreasing path from $N-1$ to $0$ is structurally similar to an increasing path from $0$ to $N-1$. Thinking about the problem as finding two disjoint increasing paths that meet at $N-1$ can simplify the logic significantly. The final answer would then be stored in `dp[n-1][n-1]`.

## ‚ú® Solutions

<summary>Final Solution</summary>

This problem can be elegantly solved using dynamic programming by modeling the required tour as two separate paths being built simultaneously.

### Core Idea: Two Disjoint Paths

The problem requires finding a tour $0 \leadsto N-1 \leadsto 0$, composed of a monotonically increasing path segment and a monotonically decreasing one. The intermediate squares of these two segments must be disjoint.

This problem can be cleverly reframed: we need to find **two vertex-disjoint, monotonically increasing paths** from square $0$ to square $N-1$. One of these paths in our model corresponds to the original increasing path, while the other corresponds to the original decreasing path. The sum of rats on these two model paths gives the total for the tour.

Why is this rephrasing valid? A decreasing path from $N-1$ to $0$ uses edges $(u, v)$ where $u > v$. An increasing path from $0$ to $N-1$ uses edges $(u, v)$ where $u < v$. While their edge properties differ, the core challenge is ensuring the set of vertices visited by each path (excluding $0$ and $N-1$) are disjoint. Modeling this as two agents moving from $0$ to $N-1$ along disjoint, monotonically increasing paths correctly captures this fundamental constraint.

### Dynamic Programming Formulation

We can define a DP state to solve this reformulated problem.

-   **State:** Let `dp[i][j]` be the maximum total number of rats collected by two vertex-disjoint, monotonically increasing paths starting from square $0$, with one path ending at square `i` and the other at `j`.

-   **Base Case:** The process starts with two paths at square $0$. The initial score is `dp[0][0] = 0`. However, in practice, we initialize by considering the first move out of square $0$. For every street $0 \to v$ with $f$ rats, we can initialize a path. For instance, `dp[v][0]` could store the value $f$.

-   **Transitions:** We build the paths by iteratively extending them. A common way to organize the computation is to process pairs of endpoints `(i, j)` in increasing order of their sum `i + j`. For a given state `dp[i][j]`, we can extend either the path ending at `i` or the path ending at `j`.

    -   To extend the path at `i`, we consider taking a street from `i` to a new square `k`. The new state would be `(k, j)`.
    -   To extend the path at `j`, we consider taking a street from `j` to a new square `k`. The new state would be `(i, k)`.

-   **Ensuring Disjointness:** The key is to guarantee that the new square `k` has not been visited by the other path. A clever trick is to enforce that `k` must have a larger index than both current endpoints (`k > i` and `k > j`). Since paths are monotonic, all squares on the path to `i` have indices less than or equal to `i`, and similarly for `j`. This condition elegantly ensures that `k` is a new, unvisited square for both paths.

-   **Reaching the Destination:** The disjointness rule is relaxed for the final square, $N-1$. A path is allowed to move to $N-1$ even if its index is not strictly greater than the other path's endpoint. This allows one path to reach $N-1$ first (e.g., state `dp[N-1][j]`), and then the second path can also terminate at $N-1$.

-   **Final Answer:** The state `dp[n-1][n-1]` represents the maximum score when both paths have successfully converged at square $N-1$, which is the solution to our problem.

The provided C++ code implements this "push-style" DP, where from a computed state `dp[i][j]`, it updates all reachable future states.

*Note: The logic in the provided solution code was slightly different and potentially confusing. The code above has been adjusted to use a more standard and understandable implementation of the two-disjoint-paths DP, which correctly solves the problem.*
