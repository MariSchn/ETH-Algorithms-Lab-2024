# Revenge of the Sith

## üìù Problem Description

You are given a set of $n$ planets, represented by their 2D coordinates. These planets are conquered by an empire in a fixed, predetermined sequence, $p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}$. Your goal is to form an alliance of the maximum possible size, $k$.

To form an alliance of size $k$, you must select $k$ distinct planets. The selection is constrained by two rules:
1.  All $k$ planets chosen for the alliance must be selected from the set of planets that have not yet been conquered by the empire. After $k$ days, planets $p_0, \ldots, p_{k-1}$ are conquered. Therefore, your selection must come from the remaining planets, $\{p_k, p_{k+1}, \ldots, p_{n-1}\}$.
2.  The selected set of $k$ planets must be "reachable". This means that the set of planets must form a single connected group. A connection between any two planets exists if the distance between them is less than or equal to a given scout vessel range, $r$. Formally, for any partition of the $k$ chosen planets into two non-empty subsets, there must be a planet in the first subset and a planet in the second subset whose distance is at most $r$.

Your task is to determine the largest integer $k$ for which such an alliance can be formed.

## üí° Hints

<summary>Hint #1</summary>
The problem asks for the *maximum* possible value of $k$. Notice that if it's possible to form an alliance of size $k$, it is also possible to form an alliance of any size smaller than $k$ (by simply taking a connected subset of the size-$k$ alliance). This monotonic property‚Äîif a property holds for $k$, it also holds for all $k' < k$‚Äîis a strong indicator that a particular search algorithm might be very effective. Which algorithm excels at finding an optimal value in a monotonic search space?
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint #2</summary>
You can apply binary search on the answer, $k$. The range for $k$ would be from $1$ to $n$. For a fixed value of $k$ in your binary search, you need a function, let's call it `is_possible(k)`, that returns `true` if an alliance of size $k$ can be formed and `false` otherwise.

How would you implement `is_possible(k)`? According to the rules, you must only consider planets $\{p_k, p_{k+1}, \ldots, p_{n-1}\}$. Among these available planets, you need to check if there is any connected group of at least $k$ planets. How can you model this connectivity and find the size of the largest group?
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint #3</summary>
To implement `is_possible(k)`, you can think of the available planets $\{p_k, \ldots, p_{n-1}\}$ as vertices in a graph. An edge exists between two vertices if the distance between their corresponding planets is at most $r$. The problem then reduces to finding the size of the largest connected component in this graph. If this size is at least $k$, then `is_possible(k)` is `true`.

A classic and efficient data structure for managing and counting connected components is the **Union-Find** (or Disjoint Set Union) data structure.

However, constructing the graph by checking all pairs of available planets would result in $O((n-k)^2)$ potential edges, which might be too slow for larger values of $n$. Since connectivity is based on geometric proximity, can you use a geometric data structure to find the necessary connections more efficiently than checking all pairs? A **Delaunay triangulation** is excellent for finding nearby neighbors.

## ‚ú® Solutions

<details>
<summary>First Solution (Test Set 1, 2)</summary>
This problem asks for the maximum integer $k$ that satisfies certain geometric connectivity properties. The monotonic nature of the problem‚Äîif an alliance of size $k$ is possible, so is one of size $k-1$‚Äîstrongly suggests that we can **binary search on the answer $k$**. Our search space for $k$ is $[1, n]$.

For the binary search to work, we need a function `possible(k)` that efficiently checks if an alliance of size $k$ is feasible.

### The `possible(k)` Check

For a given $k$, the rules state we can only use planets $\{p_k, p_{k+1}, \ldots, p_{n-1}\}$. Within this set, we need to find if there exists a connected group of at least $k$ planets. Two planets are connected if their distance is at most $r$. This is a classic connectivity problem on a graph.

1.  **Model as a Graph**: We can model the available planets as vertices. An edge exists between two vertices if their distance is $\le r$.
2.  **Find Connected Components**: Our goal is to find the size of the largest connected component in this graph.
3.  **Union-Find Data Structure**: The Union-Find (or Disjoint Set Union) data structure is perfectly suited for this. We can iterate through all pairs of available planets $(p_i, p_j)$ where $i, j \ge k$. If the squared distance between them is less than or equal to $r^2$, we `union` their sets. We also keep track of the size of each component.
4.  **Check Condition**: After processing all such pairs, we find the maximum component size. If this size is $\ge k$, then `possible(k)` returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

### Overall Algorithm

1.  Initialize a search range `low = 1`, `high = n`.
2.  While `low <= high`:
    *   Calculate `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.
    *   If `possible(mid)` is true, it means an alliance of size `mid` is achievable, so we try for a larger one: `low = mid + 1`. We also store `mid` as a potential answer.
    *   If `possible(mid)` is false, `mid` is too large, so we must try a smaller size: `high = mid - 1`.
3.  The final answer is the largest `mid` for which `possible(mid)` was true.

### Complexity and Implementation Details

The main bottleneck is the `possible(k)` function. A naive implementation that checks all pairs of the $n-k$ available planets has a time complexity of $O((n-k)^2)$. The binary search adds a $\log(n)$ factor, leading to an overall complexity of roughly $O(n^2 \log n)$, which is too slow for the larger constraints.

The provided code attempts an optimization. It first builds a Delaunay triangulation on *all* points to get a smaller set of candidate edges. However, a simple Delaunay triangulation is insufficient, as it only guarantees to include the shortest edge connecting a point to its neighbors, not all edges within a radius $r$. The code compensates for this by performing a search (like DFS or BFS) from each vertex on the triangulation to find all reachable neighbors within the radius, which still results in a large number of edges. This approach is efficient enough for the first two test sets but fails on larger inputs.

<summary>Final Solution</summary>
The previous solution was too slow because its `possible(k)` check was inefficient. The bottleneck was considering too many potential edges. The key insight for an optimal solution is to refine how we generate edges for the connectivity check.

### The Pitfall and The Optimization

A naive approach of building a Delaunay triangulation on *all* planets once and then filtering edges is flawed. Consider two planets $u$ and $v$ with indices greater than $k$ that are within distance $r$. The Delaunay triangulation might not contain the edge $(u,v)$ if another planet $w$ (with index $<k$) lies nearby. In the `possible(k)` check, planet $w$ is unavailable, so we cannot use it as an intermediate step. The direct connection $(u,v)$ is required, but our pre-computed triangulation might have missed it.

The correct and efficient approach is to build the geometric structure **inside the binary search loop**, using only the set of planets available for that specific $k$.

### Improved `possible(k)` Check

For a fixed $k$, we do the following:
1.  **Select Planets**: Create a list of planets that are available, i.e., $\{p_k, p_{k+1}, \ldots, p_{n-1}\}$.
2.  **Build Delaunay Triangulation**: Construct a Delaunay triangulation using *only* these $n-k$ available planets.
3.  **Exploit Delaunay Properties**: A crucial property of the Delaunay triangulation is that it contains all the information we need for proximity-based connectivity. If two points $u$ and $v$ are within distance $r$ of each other, there must exist a path between them in the triangulation where every edge on the path has a length at most $r$. Therefore, to check for connectivity within the radius $r$, we only need to consider the edges of the Delaunay triangulation.
4.  **Union-Find on Triangulation Edges**:
    *   Iterate through all edges of the newly built triangulation.
    *   If an edge's length is $\le r$, `union` the two endpoints in a Union-Find data structure.
    *   Keep track of component sizes.
5.  **Check Condition**: Find the maximum component size. If it is $\ge k$, return true.

### Complexity Analysis

*   **Delaunay Triangulation**: For $m = n-k$ points, construction takes approximately $O(m \log m)$ time.
*   **Edge Processing**: The number of edges in a Delaunay triangulation is linear, $O(m)$. Processing them with Union-Find takes nearly linear time, $O(m \alpha(m))$, where $\alpha$ is the very slow-growing inverse Ackermann function.
*   **Total for `possible(k)`**: The check is dominated by the triangulation, making it $O((n-k) \log(n-k))$.
*   **Overall**: The binary search performs $\log n$ calls to `possible(k)`. This gives a total time complexity of roughly $O(n \log^2 n)$, which is efficient enough to pass all test sets.
