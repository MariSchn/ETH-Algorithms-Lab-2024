# The Lernaean Hydra

## üìù Problem Description

The goal is to find the minimum number of cuts required to eradicate a set of $N$ heads, which are labeled from $0$ to $N-1$. If it's not possible to eradicate all heads, we should report it.

The process of eradication follows strict rules. First, the heads must be eradicated in a specific sequence: head $0$, then head $1$, and so on, up to head $N-1$. To attempt to eradicate head $i$, all heads $j < i$ must have already been successfully eradicated.

An eradication is successful if and only if the sequence of the last $k$ cuts performed matches one of the $m$ given "eradication patterns." An eradication pattern is a sequence of $k$ head indices. The final head in the pattern sequence, $h_{k-1}$, is the one that is targeted for eradication. A crucial constraint is that once a head has been eradicated, it cannot be part of any subsequent cuts.

The input provides the number of heads $N$, the number of eradication patterns $m$, and the length of each pattern $k$. You are also given the $m$ patterns themselves. The task is to determine the length of the shortest possible sequence of cuts that eradicates all $N$ heads.

## üí° Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint #1</summary>
The problem specifies a strict order for eradicating the heads: $0, 1, \dots, N-1$. The process of eradicating head $i$ can only begin after head $i-1$ is gone. This sequential nature suggests that you can build the solution step-by-step, solving for one head at a time. Think about what information you need to carry over from the successful eradication of head $i-1$ to calculate the cost of eradicating head $i$.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint #2</summary>
The cost to eradicate head $i$ is not fixed; it depends on the sequence of cuts used to eradicate head $i-1$. Specifically, the last few cuts might be reusable as the first few cuts for the new pattern. This structure is very similar to finding a shortest path. Can you model this problem as finding the shortest path where "states" represent the progress made? What information would define a state? A state must surely include which head was just eradicated, but what else is needed to calculate the cost of the next step?
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint #3</summary>
This problem is a perfect fit for Dynamic Programming. Let's define a DP state. A natural choice is $DP(i, p)$, representing the minimum total cuts to eradicate all heads up to and including head $i$, with the eradication of head $i$ being accomplished using pattern $p$.

To compute $DP(i, p_{\text{current}})$, you would transition from a state for the previous head, $(i-1, p_{\text{previous}})$. The number of additional cuts required for this transition depends on the overlap between the end of the cut sequence for $p_{\text{previous}}$ and the beginning of the pattern $p_{\text{current}}$. A larger overlap means fewer new cuts are needed. A critical detail is to always verify that any new, non-overlapping cuts do not involve heads that have already been eradicated.

<summary>First Solution (Test Set 1, 3)</summary>

This problem can be effectively modeled using Dynamic Programming due to its sequential nature and optimal substructure. We must eradicate heads in the order $0, 1, \dots, N-1$. The cost of eradicating head $i$ depends on the final sequence of cuts used for head $i-1$.

### DP State Definition
Let's define our DP state as $DP(i, p)$, which stores the minimum number of cuts required to eradicate heads $0$ through $i$, where pattern $p$ is used to eradicate head $i$. Here, $p$ is not the pattern itself, but an index referring to the $p$-th pattern available for eradicating head $i$.

To manage the patterns efficiently, we can preprocess the input by grouping all $m$ patterns based on the head they eradicate. `head_to_patterns[i]` will be a list of all patterns that end with head $i$.

### DP Initialization
The DP table, `dp[i][p]`, will be initialized with infinity to represent unreachable states.

**Base Case (i=0):** To eradicate the first head (head 0), we have no prior cuts to reuse. Therefore, for any pattern $p$ that eradicates head 0, the number of cuts is simply the full pattern length, $k$.
$DP(0, p) = k$ for all patterns $p$ that eradicate head 0.

### DP Transition
For each subsequent head $i > 0$, we calculate $DP(i, p_{\text{curr}})$ by considering all possible previous states, i.e., all patterns $p_{\text{prev}}$ used to eradicate head $i-1$.

For each pair $(p_{\text{prev}}, p_{\text{curr}})$, we can make a transition. The cost of this transition is the number of *new* cuts we must add. This can happen in two main ways:

1.  **No Overlap:** We can always choose to perform the full sequence for $p_{\text{curr}}$ without reusing any previous cuts. The number of new cuts is $k$. The total cost would be $DP(i-1, p_{\text{prev}}) + k$. However, this is only valid if the pattern $p_{\text{curr}}$ does not require cutting any already-eradicated heads (i.e., any head $j < i$). We must check for this.

2.  **With Overlap:** We can try to reuse the last few cuts from the eradication of head $i-1$. We check for all possible overlaps of length `n_matches` (from $1$ to $k-1$) between the suffix of the sequence for $p_{\text{prev}}$ and the prefix of the pattern $p_{\text{curr}}$. If an overlap of `n_matches` is found, we only need to perform $k - \text{n\_matches}$ new cuts. The total cost is updated as:
    $DP(i, p_{\text{curr}}) = \min(DP(i, p_{\text{curr}}), DP(i-1, p_{\text{prev}}) + k - \text{n\_matches})$.

### Flaw in this Approach
This initial approach has a subtle bug. In the "No Overlap" case, we correctly check if the *entire* new pattern is valid. However, in the "With Overlap" case, the logic above only checks if the patterns match but **fails to check if the new, non-overlapping cuts are valid**. A new cut for head $h$ is invalid if $h < i$. This omission causes the algorithm to produce incorrect results on more complex test cases.

### Final Answer
The minimum total cuts to slay the Hydra is the minimum value found in the last row of our DP table: $\min_{p} DP(N-1, p)$. If all entries in this row remain infinity, the task is impossible.

<summary>Final Solution</summary>
This solution corrects the flaw in the previous approach. The overall Dynamic Programming structure remains the same, but we add a crucial validation step within the transition logic.

### The Correction
The oversight in the first solution was failing to validate the new, non-overlapping cuts when a partial match between patterns was found. Even if the first `n_matches` cuts of a new pattern `p_curr` can be reused from a previous sequence, we must ensure that the remaining `k - n_matches` cuts are valid. A cut is valid only if it targets a head that has not yet been eradicated.

When we are trying to eradicate head $i$, all heads $j < i$ are already gone. Therefore, any new cut must be for a head $h \ge i$.

### Modified DP Transition
The DP state, base case, and general logic are identical to the first solution. We only modify the transition for the "With Overlap" case.

When checking for an overlap of `n_matches` between $p_{\text{prev}}$ and $p_{\text{curr}}$:
1.  **First, check validity:** Before checking for a pattern match, we verify if the new, non-overlapping part of $p_{\text{curr}}$ is valid. We iterate through the last $k - \text{n\_matches}$ elements of $p_{\text{curr}}$ (from index `n_matches` to `k-1`) and check if any of these heads have an index less than $i$. If they do, this transition is impossible for this `n_matches` length, and we must continue to the next possibility.
2.  **Then, check for match:** If the new cuts are all valid, we proceed to check if the prefix of $p_{\text{curr}}$ matches the suffix of the cut sequence from $p_{\text{prev}}$.
3.  **Update DP table:** If both conditions are met, we update the DP table with the new minimum cost:
    $DP(i, p_{\text{curr}}) = \min(DP(i, p_{\text{curr}}), DP(i-1, p_{\text{prev}}) + k - \text{n\_matches})$.

By adding this validity check, the algorithm correctly handles all constraints of the problem and finds the optimal solution for all test cases.
