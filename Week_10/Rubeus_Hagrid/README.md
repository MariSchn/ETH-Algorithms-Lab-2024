## üìù Problem Description

You are given a system comprising a surface entry point and $N$ underground chambers. These locations are interconnected by a network of two-way tunnels, each with a specified length. The layout is structured such that from any chamber, there exists a unique path leading back to the surface entry point.

Initially, each chamber $i$ contains a certain number of galleons, $g_i$. The task involves planning a traversal that begins at the surface entry point. Travel time through any tunnel is equal to its length. As time passes, the treasure diminishes: for every second elapsed from the start of the traversal, one galleon vanishes from each chamber that has not yet been visited.

When a chamber is reached at time $t$, all of its remaining galleons are collected instantly. The number of galleons collected from chamber $i$ if it's reached at time $t$ is therefore $g_i - t$. It is guaranteed that for any valid traversal, at least one galleon will remain in a chamber when it is visited for the first time.

The objective is to determine a traversal strategy that maximizes the total number of galleons collected. The traversal must start at the surface, visit every chamber exactly once to collect its galleons, and finally return to the surface. Each tunnel can be traversed at most twice (once in each direction). For each test case, you are to output a single integer representing this maximum possible number of collected galleons.

## üí° Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint #1</summary>
The problem describes a set of locations (chambers and an entry point) connected by tunnels, with the specific property that there is a unique path from any chamber back to the entry point. This structure is a fundamental concept in algorithmics. What is it called? Consider how a traversal that must visit every location might work within this structure, especially given the constraint that tunnels can be used at most twice.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint #2</summary>
The requirement to visit every chamber, combined with the constraint that each tunnel is traversed at most once in each direction, strongly suggests a full traversal of the structure. A Depth-First Search (DFS) is a natural fit for this pattern of exploration. However, a standard DFS explores branches in an arbitrary order. Here, the order matters. The core of the problem is to find the *optimal* order to explore the different branches from any given junction to maximize the total galleons.

<summary>Hint #3</summary>
At every second, you lose a total number of galleons equal to the number of chambers you haven't visited yet. To minimize this loss, you should aim to visit chambers as quickly as possible, thereby reducing the count of "unvisited" chambers. When you are at a chamber with several sub-networks to explore, which one should you choose first? A good greedy heuristic would be to prioritize the sub-network that is most "efficient" to clear. Think about how to define this efficiency. It should likely involve a trade-off between how many chambers a sub-network contains and how long it takes to fully explore it.

<details>
<summary>Hint #4</summary>
Let's formalize the greedy choice. Suppose from your current location, you can explore two sub-networks, A and B. Sub-network A has $N_A$ chambers and takes $T_A$ time to fully traverse (go in, visit everything, and return). Sub-network B has $N_B$ chambers and takes $T_B$ time.
If you visit A then B, the $N_B$ chambers in B will each lose an additional $T_A$ galleons while you are busy in A. The "cross-loss" is $N_B \times T_A$.
If you visit B then A, the "cross-loss" is $N_A \times T_B$.
To minimize loss, you should visit A first if $N_B \times T_A < N_A \times T_B$, which is equivalent to $\frac{T_A}{N_A} < \frac{T_B}{N_B}$. This gives you the greedy criterion: always explore the sub-network with the smallest (Traversal Time / Number of Chambers) ratio first.

## ‚ú® Solutions

<details>
<summary>Final Solution</summary>
This problem can be modeled using a tree data structure. The surface entry point is the root of the tree, the chambers are the nodes, and the tunnels are the edges. The property that "from every chamber there is a unique sequence of tunnels leading up to the surface" confirms that the structure is indeed a tree.

The niffler's journey requires visiting every chamber, which corresponds to a full traversal of the tree. The constraint that each tunnel is used at most twice (once down, once up) perfectly describes a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal that explores a subtree completely before backtracking.

### The Greedy Strategy

The challenge is that not all DFS traversals are equal. The order in which we explore the subtrees from any node affects the total galleons collected. At each second, we lose one galleon from every unvisited chamber. To maximize our collection, we must minimize this loss. This means we should try to reduce the number of unvisited chambers as quickly as possible.

This observation leads to a greedy approach. Whenever we are at a node with multiple children (and thus multiple subtrees to explore), we should prioritize the one that is most "efficient" to clear. We derived the efficiency metric in the hints: we should visit the subtree with the minimum ratio of $\frac{\text{Traversal Time}}{\text{Number of Nodes}}$. By always picking the subtree with the lowest time-per-node cost, we minimize the time that other, larger subtrees have to wait, thus minimizing the overall loss of galleons.

### Two-Pass DFS Implementation

To implement this greedy strategy, we need two key pieces of information for each subtree: its size (number of nodes) and the total time required to traverse it. We can compute these using a two-pass DFS approach.

**1. First Pass: Information Gathering (`fill_fields`)**

We perform a post-order traversal (a type of DFS) starting from the root to compute the required statistics for each node. For each node `u`, we need:
-   `n_nodes`: The total number of nodes in the subtree rooted at `u`. This is simply $1$ (for `u` itself) plus the sum of `n_nodes` of all its children.
-   `traverse_time`: The time required to fully explore the subtree rooted at `u` and return to `u`. For a leaf, this is 0. For an internal node `u`, this is the sum of `(2 * length_to_child_v + traverse_time_of_v)` over all its children `v`. To simplify calculations and avoid large numbers, the provided code cleverly calculates *half* of this traversal time. Let's call it `half_traversal_time`. For a node `u`, `half_traversal_time[u] = sum(half_traversal_time[v] + length_to_child_v)`.

**2. Second Pass: Value Calculation (`calculate_values`)**

With the precomputed values, we perform a second DFS to calculate the maximum number of galleons.
-   This traversal also proceeds from the root. At each node `u`, we sort its children `v` in ascending order based on our greedy criterion: $\frac{\text{half\_traversal\_time}[v] + \text{length}(u,v)}{\text{n\_nodes}[v]}$. To avoid floating-point arithmetic, we use integer cross-multiplication for the comparison: $\frac{T_A}{N_A} < \frac{T_B}{N_B} \iff T_A \times N_B < T_B \times N_A$.
-   We keep track of the `elapsed_time` since the start of the journey. When we move from a parent `u` to a child `v` through a tunnel of length `l`, the elapsed time increases by `l`.
-   We recursively call the function on the children in the sorted order. After returning from a child `v`'s subtree, the time spent was `2 * (half_traversal_time[v] + l)`. This duration is added to `elapsed_time` before proceeding to the next sibling.
-   The final value for a subtree at `u` is the sum of galleons collected at `u` (`raw_value - elapsed_time_at_u`) and the total galleons collected from all its child subtrees.

The final answer is the total value calculated for the root node (the surface entry point).
