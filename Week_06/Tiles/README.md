# Tiles

## üìù Problem Description

The task is to determine whether a given rectangular layout can be completely tiled using 2x1 tiles, given the dimensions of the layout, $W$ and $H$. The layout itself is represented as a grid where each space is either designated to be tiled or to be left empty.

Each 2x1 tile must cover exactly two adjacent spaces that are marked for tiling. These adjacent spaces can be either horizontal or vertical neighbors. Every space that needs to be tiled must be covered by exactly one tile, and no tiles can be placed on spaces designated to be left empty.

## üí° Hints

<summary>Hint #1</summary>

Before diving into complex algorithms, consider a simple, fundamental property of the tiles. Each tile covers exactly two spaces. What does this imply about the total number of spaces that need to be tiled for a valid solution to even be possible?

</details>

<details>

<summary>Hint #2</summary>

This problem is about pairing up adjacent, tileable spaces. How can you model this? Think about representing each tileable space as an object and the potential placement of a tile between two adjacent spaces as a connection between them. This reframes the problem from laying tiles to finding a perfect set of pairings.

<summary>Hint #3</summary>

The problem can be solved by finding a **maximum matching**. To construct the required model, it's incredibly helpful to color the grid like a checkerboard. Notice that any 2x1 tile will always cover one "white" space and one "black" space. This structure allows you to create a **bipartite graph**. Maximum matching in a bipartite graph is a classic problem that can be solved efficiently using a max-flow algorithm or other matching algorithms.

<summary>First Solution (Test Set 3, 4)</summary>

This solution approaches the problem by modeling the tileable spaces as vertices in a graph and using **maximum flow** to try to pair up adjacent spaces. The implementation colors the grid in a checkerboard pattern (based on whether `(row + col)` is even or odd), alternating which spaces are connected to the source and sink.

The key insight is that any 2√ó1 tile must cover two adjacent spaces, and the checkerboard coloring is used to ensure that every tile covers one space of each color. The solution constructs bidirectional edges between adjacent tileable spaces and runs the flow algorithm twice (once with `odd=false` and once with `odd=true`) to cover both possible colorings, checking if either produces a perfect matching.

While this approach demonstrates a solid attempt to model the pairing constraints, the use of bidirectional edges and the need to try both coloring options make the graph construction less efficient and can limit its effectiveness on certain test cases. Nevertheless, the solution manages to pass some test sets by "brute-forcing" both coloring options.

<summary>Final Solution</summary>

**Note**: While this solution does not do it, you can solve this problem much more easily using a matching algorithm.


This problem can be elegantly solved by modeling it as a maximum flow problem, but the final solution improves on the first by making the graph construction more efficient and by leveraging the structure of the grid more directly.

The first solution attempts to pair up adjacent spaces using a checkerboard coloring, but it constructs bidirectional edges and must try both possible colorings, which is inefficient and can be error-prone. The final solution, uses a single coloring and only adds edges in one direction (from one color to the other), which avoids redundancy and simplifies the graph. This makes it only necessary to calculate one flow and solves test set 1 and 2.

### From Tiling to Graphs

We represent the garden layout as a graph. Each space `(r, c)` that can be tiled (marked with a '.') becomes a vertex. An edge exists between two vertices if their corresponding spaces are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) in the grid. A tiling of the garden corresponds to a **matching** in this graph (a set of edges where no two edges share a vertex). A **perfect matching** is a matching that covers every single vertex in the graph. Our goal is to find out if such a perfect matching exists.

### Bipartite Matching and Max-Flow

Finding a maximum matching in a general graph can be complex. However, our graph has a special property. We can color the grid like a checkerboard. A space at `(r, c)` can be colored "white" if `(r + c)` is even and "black" if `(r + c)` is odd. Crucially, any 2x1 tile placed on the grid will always cover exactly one white space and one black space. This means we can partition our graph's vertices into two sets (white and black) where edges only exist *between* the sets, not within them. This is the definition of a **bipartite graph**.

The problem of finding a maximum matching in a bipartite graph can be transformed into a maximum flow problem using the **Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem**. We construct a flow network as follows:

1.  **Source and Sink:** Create a source vertex `S` and a sink vertex `T`.
2.  **Source to White Vertices:** For every "white" tileable space `u`, add a directed edge from `S` to `u` with a capacity of 1. This represents that each white space can be the start of one tile.
3.  **Black Vertices to Sink:** For every "black" tileable space `v`, add a directed edge from `v` to `T` with a capacity of 1. This represents that each black space can be the end of one tile.
4.  **White to Black Vertices:** For every pair of adjacent white and black tileable spaces, `u` and `v` respectively, add a directed edge from `u` to `v` with a capacity of 1. This represents the possibility of placing a tile between them.

### Interpreting the Result

The maximum flow from `S` to `T` in this network corresponds to the maximum number of tiles that can be placed, which is the size of the maximum matching. Let `N` be the total number of tileable spaces.

-   If `N` is odd, a perfect tiling is impossible, as each tile covers two spaces.
-   If `N` is even, a perfect tiling exists if and only if we can place `N / 2` tiles. This means the maximum flow must be equal to `N / 2`.
-   Therefore, the condition for a successful tiling is: **`max_flow * 2 == N`**.
