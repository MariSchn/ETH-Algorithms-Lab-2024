# Algocoon Group

## üìù Problem Description

The problem asks for the minimum cost to partition a set of figures into two non-empty groups. We are given $N$ figures, indexed from $0$ to $N-1$, and a list of $M$ limbs that connect them. Each limb is described by the two figures it connects, say $a$ and $b$, and a cost $c$ to cut it.

A partition of the figures into two groups defines a "cut". The total cost of this cut is the sum of the costs of all limbs connecting a figure in the first group to a figure in the second group. The objective is to find a partition that minimizes this total cost, under the constraint that both groups must be non-empty.

<summary>Hint #1</summary>

The problem asks for a minimum cost to "cut" a set of interconnected items into two distinct groups. This phrasing is a strong clue towards a specific family of algorithms. How can you model the figures and their connections in a way that allows you to apply a standard algorithm for finding a minimum cut?

</details>

<details>

<summary>Hint #2</summary>

This problem can be modeled using a graph. Let each figure be a nodex and each limb be an edge between the corresponding nodes. The cost associated with cutting a limb can be represented as the capacity of that edge. The problem is now equivalent to finding a minimum cut that partitions the graph's nodes into two non-empty sets.

<details>

<summary>Hint #3</summary>

A standard minimum cut is defined between a source nodex $s$ and a sink nodex $t$. This cut separates the nodes into two sets: one containing $s$ (the source side) and the other containing $t$ (the sink side). The problem requires finding the minimum cut among all possible non-trivial partitions. How can we choose $s$ and $t$ to guarantee we find the overall minimum cut? Consider fixing one nodex and exploring its relationship with all other nodes.

<summary>First Solution (Test Set 1)</summary>

By reading the problem description we already get a feeling that this is going to be a **Minimum Cut** problem.

As we want to cut the individual figures, we will design our graph as follows:

- Each **figure becomes a node**.
- The **limbs become edges between nodes**, with their corresponding cost as capacity.

The main challenge we now have is, that we have to **ensure, that both people get at least one figure**. More formally this means, that there needs to be **at least one node in $S$ and $T = V\setminus S$**. 

Given the assumption on the test set 1, we know that there exists a solution where A gets figure $0$ and B gets figure $n-1$. So we can **simply use these 2 figures/nodes as source and sink**.

By choosing nodes that are already in the graph, we can ensure that $S$ and $T$ will be non-empty as obviously, after the max flow the source $s$ will be connected to the source, so $s \in S$ and the sink $t$ will be connected to the sink, so $t \in T$. 

We can then simply **calculate the Min Cut by calculating the Max Flow**, as the **Maxflow-Mincut-Theorem** states that both are equal.

<summary>Second Solution (Test Set 1, 2)</summary>

The only difference when moving from test set 1 to test set 2 is that we can now **no longer assume that the optimal solution assigns $n-1$ to B**.
What we can simply do, is that we **loop over all nodes**, assign them to B (assign them as sink) and calculate the flow.

In the end we simply return the **minimum of the cuts we found**.

This is a pretty "brute-forcy‚Äù approach, that can be improved, see the next solution

<summary>Third Solution (Test Set 3)</summary>

For the third test set, all special assumptions are removed. We need to find the **global minimum cut** of the graph, which is the non-trivial cut of minimum capacity over all possible pairs of partitions.

### Brute-Force Approach
A straightforward way to find the global minimum cut is to find the minimum $s-t$ cut for every possible pair of distinct nodes $(s, t)$. Since any non-trivial cut separates at least two nodes, the global minimum cut must be an $s-t$ cut for some pair $(s, t)$.

### Complexity Analysis
The number of pairs $(s, t)$ is $N \times (N-1)$, which is $O(N^2)$. The push-relabel max-flow algorithm has a complexity of roughly $O(N^3)$ in practice on general graphs. Therefore, the total time complexity of this approach is $O(N^2 \cdot N^3) = O(N^5)$. For Test Set 3 with $N \le 50$, this is feasible, but it is too slow for the full constraints.

<summary>Final Solution</summary>

To make the third solution faster, we simply need to **exploit the fact that we have already used in the first 2 solutions**. In general we basically only **need 2 nodes such that one of them is in $S$ and the other in $T$**, and then we can calculate the max flow to get the min cut.

However, now we do **not know anything about which node belongs to which set**. Intuitively we would therefore just iterate over all pairs (like in the third solution). This, as we have seen, is to inefficient.

BUT, we know that **each node has to belong to either $S$ or $T$**. What we can therefore do is **fix one node** (e.g. node $0$) and **use it as a source** and **compute the max flow to all other nodes** (/consider all other nodes as sinks). If $0 \in S$, then this will already yield the min cut. 
This is because for at least one other node $i$, we will basically have the same situation as in Test set 1, where this also worked. 
Note, that up until now we are basically **doing the same as in the second Solution**.

This will only fail if $0 \in T$, since then our assumption that $0 \in S$ does no longer hold. **BUT** if $0 \in T$, we can do the **exact same as before**, just that we know use $0$ as a sink and compute the max flow from all other nodes (consider every other node a source). 
With this we have then covered both cases $0 \in S$ and $0 \in T$, and can therefore say for sure, that we have found the min cut, while only needing to run max flow $O(2N)$ times instead of $O(N^2)$ times.
