# Algoco√∂n Group

## üìù Problem Description

The problem asks for the minimum cost to partition a set of figures into two non-empty groups. We are given $N$ figures, indexed from $0$ to $N-1$, and a list of $M$ limbs that connect them. Each limb is described by the two figures it connects, say $a$ and $b$, and a cost $c$ to cut it.

A partition of the figures into two groups defines a "cut". The total cost of this cut is the sum of the costs of all limbs connecting a figure in the first group to a figure in the second group. The objective is to find a partition that minimizes this total cost, under the constraint that both groups must be non-empty. For each sculpture described, the program should output this single minimum cost.

<summary>Hint #1</summary>
The problem asks for a minimum cost to "cut" a set of interconnected items into two distinct groups. This phrasing is a strong clue towards a specific family of algorithms. How can you model the figures and their connections in a way that allows you to apply a standard algorithm for finding a minimum cut?
</details>
<details>
<summary>Hint #2</summary>
This problem can be modeled using a graph. Let each figure be a vertex and each limb be an edge between the corresponding vertices. The cost associated with cutting a limb can be represented as the capacity of that edge. The problem is now equivalent to finding a minimum cut that partitions the graph's vertices into two non-empty sets.

<details>
<summary>Hint #3</summary>
A standard minimum cut is defined between a source vertex $s$ and a sink vertex $t$. This cut separates the vertices into two sets: one containing $s$ (the source side) and the other containing $t$ (the sink side). The problem requires finding the minimum cut among all possible non-trivial partitions. How can we choose $s$ and $t$ to guarantee we find the overall minimum cut? Consider fixing one vertex and exploring its relationship with all other vertices.

<summary>First Solution (Test Set 1)</summary>
This problem can be framed as a **Minimum Cut** problem on a graph. The direct connection between cutting limbs and finding a minimum cut in a graph is a key observation.

### Graph Representation
We can model the sculpture as a graph where:
- Each of the $N$ figures is a **vertex**.
- Each limb connecting two figures is an **edge** between the corresponding vertices. Since a limb from figure $a$ to figure $b$ is the same as one from $b$ to $a$, we can think of this as an undirected connection. When modeling for max-flow, we represent this with two directed edges. The **capacity** of an edge is set to the cost of cutting the corresponding limb.

### Applying the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem
The famous **Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem** states that the maximum flow between a source vertex $s$ and a sink vertex $t$ in a network is equal to the minimum capacity of an $s-t$ cut. An $s-t$ cut is a partition of the vertices into two sets, $S$ and $T$, such that $s \in S$ and $t \in T$. The capacity of the cut is the sum of capacities of all edges going from $S$ to $T$.

For the first test set, we are given a crucial hint: there is an optimal solution where you get Figure 0 and your friend gets Figure $N-1$. This directly tells us which vertices to use as the source and sink.
- We can designate **vertex 0 as the source ($s$)** and **vertex $N-1$ as the sink ($t$)**.
- By finding the maximum flow from $s$ to $t$, we simultaneously find the minimum cost to separate vertex 0 from vertex $N-1$.

Since the problem guarantees that this specific partition is optimal, a single max-flow computation is sufficient. The code handles multiple limbs between the same two figures by adding their capacities, which is implicitly done by adding parallel edges in the graph representation.

<summary>Second Solution (Test Set 1, 2)</summary>
For the second test set, the assumption is relaxed. We are now only guaranteed that an optimal solution exists where you get Figure 0. This means Figure 0 is in your partition (let's call it $S$), but your friend's partition ($T$) can be anchored by *any* other figure.

### Approach
Since we know Figure 0 will be on the source side of our cut, we can fix **vertex 0 as the source ($s$)**. The problem is that we don't know which vertex from the other partition to pick as the sink ($t$).

The constraint that both partitions must be non-empty implies that the friend's partition $T$ must contain at least one figure, say figure $j$. The cost of this partition is the capacity of the minimum cut separating $S$ and $T$. This cut is an $s-t$ cut where $s \in S$ and $t \in T$.

Since we know $s=0$, we can find the optimal partition by trying every other possible vertex as the sink. We iterate through all vertices $i \in \{1, 2, \dots, n-1\}$, set each one as the sink, and compute the max-flow from source 0 to sink $i$. The overall minimum cost will be the minimum value found across all these computations.

This approach is effectively a brute-force search for the best partner vertex for our fixed vertex 0.

### Algorithm
1. Build the same graph as in the first solution.
2. Fix `v_source = 0`.
3. Initialize `min_cut` to a very large value.
4. Loop through every other vertex `i` from `1` to `n-1`:
   a. Set `v_sink = i`.
   b. Calculate the max-flow from `v_source` to `v_sink`. Note that max-flow algorithms modify the graph's residual capacities, so we must reconstruct the graph for each sink candidate.
   c. Update `min_cut = min(min_cut, flow)`.
5. The final `min_cut` is the answer.

*Note: A more efficient implementation would avoid rebuilding the entire graph. One could save the initial capacities and restore them before each max-flow call. The provided code is simpler but correct for the given constraints.*

<summary>Third Solution (Test Set 3)</summary>
For the third test set, all special assumptions are removed. We need to find the **global minimum cut** of the graph, which is the non-trivial cut of minimum capacity over all possible pairs of partitions.

### Brute-Force Approach
A straightforward way to find the global minimum cut is to find the minimum $s-t$ cut for every possible pair of distinct vertices $(s, t)$. Since any non-trivial cut separates at least two vertices, the global minimum cut must be an $s-t$ cut for some pair $(s, t)$.

This leads to a simple, albeit inefficient, algorithm:
1. Build the graph from the input. To handle parallel edges cleanly, we can first accumulate the costs in an adjacency matrix and then build the graph.
2. Initialize `min_cut` to a very large value.
3. Iterate through every vertex `s` from `0` to `n-1`.
4. Inside this loop, iterate through every other vertex `t` from `0` to `n-1`.
5. If `s != t`:
   a. Calculate the max-flow from `s` to `t`. Remember to restore the graph's capacities before each calculation.
   b. Update `min_cut = min(min_cut, flow)`.
6. The final `min_cut` is the answer.

### Complexity Analysis
The number of pairs $(s, t)$ is $N \times (N-1)$, which is $O(N^2)$. The push-relabel max-flow algorithm has a complexity of roughly $O(N^3)$ in practice on general graphs. Therefore, the total time complexity of this approach is $O(N^2 \cdot N^3) = O(N^5)$. For Test Set 3 with $N \le 50$, this is feasible, but it is too slow for the full constraints.

<details>
<summary>Final Solution</summary>
The brute-force $O(N^5)$ approach is too slow for the full constraints. We need a more efficient way to find the global minimum cut. Instead of iterating through all $O(N^2)$ pairs of vertices, we can find the solution by performing only $O(N)$ max-flow computations.

### The Key Insight
Let the global minimum cut partition the vertices into sets $S_{opt}$ and $T_{opt}$. Now, let's pick an arbitrary vertex, for instance, **vertex 0**. In the optimal partition, vertex 0 must belong to either $S_{opt}$ or $T_{opt}$. This gives us two exhaustive cases:

1.  **Case A: Vertex 0 is in $S_{opt}$**.
    Since $T_{opt}$ is non-empty, it must contain at least one vertex, say $j$. The capacity of the cut $(S_{opt}, T_{opt})$ is equal to the capacity of the minimum $s-t$ cut for *any* pair of vertices $s \in S_{opt}$ and $t \in T_{opt}$. In particular, its capacity is equal to the minimum $0-j$ cut. To find the minimum cut under this case, we can compute the minimum $0-i$ cut for all other vertices $i \neq 0$. This is precisely the logic from our second solution: `min(max_flow(0, i))` for $i \in \{1, \dots, n-1\}$.

2.  **Case B: Vertex 0 is in $T_{opt}$**.
    Similarly, $S_{opt}$ must contain at least one vertex, say $i$. The capacity of the optimal cut is equal to the minimum $i-0$ cut. To cover this case, we can compute the minimum $i-0$ cut for all other vertices $i \neq 0$. This means we calculate `min(max_flow(i, 0))` for $i \in \{1, \dots, n-1\}$.

Since any optimal cut must fall into either Case A or Case B, the global minimum cut must be among the values we computed. By taking the minimum over all $2(N-1)$ max-flow computations, we are guaranteed to find the global minimum.

### Algorithm
1. Build the graph from the input, aggregating capacities of parallel edges.
2. Fix one vertex, say `v_ref = 0`.
3. Initialize `min_cut` to a very large value.
4. For each vertex `i` from `1` to `n-1`:
   a. Calculate `flow = max_flow(v_ref, i)`. Update `min_cut = min(min_cut, flow)`.
5. The resulting `min_cut` is the answer.

This reduces the number of max-flow computations from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N-1)$, yielding a total complexity of $O(N \cdot \text{MaxFlow})$, which is efficient enough to pass all test sets.

*Note: In an undirected graph, the min $s-t$ cut is the same as the min $t-s$ cut. So we only need to iterate through all `max_flow(0, i)` for `i=1...n-1`. The provided code calculates both `max_flow(0, i)` and `max_flow(i, 0)` which is redundant but correct.*
