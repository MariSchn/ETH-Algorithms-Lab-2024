# Inball

## üìù Problem Description

The problem asks for the maximum possible integral radius of a $d$-dimensional ball that can be contained within a convex polyhedron. This polyhedron is defined as the intersection of $n$ half-spaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Each half-space is given by a linear inequality of the form $a_i^T x \leq b_i$, where $x$ is a point in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $a_i$ is a $d$-dimensional vector, and $b_i$ is a scalar.

<summary>Hint #2</summary>

Let's model the problem more formally. The center of the ball can be represented by a vector of variables $x = (x_1, \dots, x_d)$, and its radius by another variable $r$. For the ball to be contained within the region defined by an inequality $a_i^T x \le b_i$, its center $x$ must be at a sufficient distance from the boundary hyperplane $a_i^T y = b_i$. How can you express the geometric condition "the distance from point $x$ to the hyperplane $a_i^T y = b_i$ is at least $r$" as a mathematical inequality?

<summary>Hint #3</summary>

The perpendicular distance from a point $x_0$ to a hyperplane defined by $a^T x = b$ is given by the formula $\frac{|a^T x_0 - b|}{\|a\|_2}$. For our ball to be inside the polyhedron, its center $x$ must satisfy $a_i^T x \le b_i$ for all $i$. The condition that the ball does not cross the hyperplane boundary translates to requiring the distance from its center $x$ to each hyperplane $a_i^T y = b_i$ to be at least $r$.

This gives us the set of constraints:
$$ \frac{b_i - a_i^T x}{\|a_i\|_2} \ge r \quad \text{for all } i = 1, \dots, n $$
This can be rearranged into a linear inequality:
$$ a_i^T x + r \cdot \|a_i\|_2 \le b_i $$
With the objective to maximize $r$, this forms a complete **Linear Program (LP)**.

<summary>First Solution (Test Set 1, 2)</summary>

This problem can be elegantly modeled as a **Linear Program (LP)**. We are trying to maximize a value, the radius $r$, subject to a set of linear constraints that define the "cave". The initial solution for this problem relies on normalizing all constraints, motivated by the geometric interpretation of the problem.


### Geometric Intuition
Let the center of the $d$-dimensional ball be the vector $x = (x_1, \dots, x_d)$ and its radius be $r$. The cave is defined by $n$ inequalities $a_i^T x \le b_i$.

The expression $a_i^T x$ is the scalar projection of vector $x$ onto vector $a_i$, scaled by the length of $a_i$. If we normalize $a_i$ to have a unit norm (i.e., $\|a_i\|_2 = 1$), then $a_i^T x$ gives the signed distance of the point $x$ from a hyperplane passing through the origin with normal vector $a_i$. The term $b_i$ effectively shifts this hyperplane. The distance from a point $x$ to the hyperplane $a_i^T y = b_i$ is $\frac{b_i - a_i^T x}{\|a_i\|_2}$.

For a ball of radius $r$ centered at $x$ to be fully contained within the cave, it must not cross any of the boundary hyperplanes. This means the distance from its center $x$ to every hyperplane must be at least $r$. This gives us the following condition for each constraint $i$:
$$ \frac{b_i - a_i^T x}{\|a_i\|_2} \geq r $$
Rearranging this, we get:
$$ a_i^T x + r \cdot \|a_i\|_2 \le b_i $$

### LP Formulation
A straightforward way to implement this is to first normalize each constraint. Let $a'_i = \frac{a_i}{\|a_i\|_2}$ and $b'_i = \frac{b_i}{\|a_i\|_2}$. The constraint then simplifies to:
$$ (a'_i)^T x + r \le b'_i $$
This is a linear inequality in terms of the variables $x_1, \dots, x_d$ and $r$.

Our complete LP is:
- **Variables:** $x_1, \dots, x_d, r$
- **Objective:** Maximize $r$
- **Constraints:**
    1. $(a'_i)^T x + r \le b'_i$ for all $i = 1, \dots, n$
    2. $r \ge 0$ (a radius cannot be negative)

This approach is correct but involves many divisions using `CGAL::Gmpq` rational numbers during the normalization step, which can be computationally expensive and leads to a "Time Limit Exceeded" verdict on larger test sets.

<summary>Final Solution</summary>

The previous solution is functionally correct but suffers from performance issues due to the explicit normalization step, which involves a large number of divisions with exact rational numbers. We can significantly optimize the process by reformulating the constraints to avoid these divisions.

#### Algebraic Optimization

Recall the fundamental constraint derived from the distance formula for each hyperplane $i$:
$$ \frac{b_i - a_i^T x}{\|a_i\|_2} \ge r $$
Instead of dividing the left side by the norm $\|a_i\|_2$, we can multiply both sides by it. Since the norm is always non-negative, this does not change the direction of the inequality:
$$ b_i - a_i^T x \ge r \cdot \|a_i\|_2 $$
Rearranging this gives us a new, equivalent linear constraint:
$$ a_i^T x + \|a_i\|_2 \cdot r \le b_i $$

This formulation is algebraically equivalent to the normalized version but computationally superior. It avoids the loop of $n \times d$ divisions, replacing them with a single multiplication by the norm in each constraint setup. Since the norms $\|a_i\|_2$ are integers (as per the problem statement), all coefficients in the LP will be integers, which is much more efficient for the solver.

#### Optimized LP Formulation
- **Variables:** $x_1, \dots, x_d, r$
- **Objective:** Maximize $r$
- **Constraints:**
    1. $a_i^T x + \|a_i\|_2 \cdot r \le b_i$ for all $i = 1, \dots, n$
    2. $r \ge 0$
